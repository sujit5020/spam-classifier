Spam message classification using machine learning
# Spam Classifier Web App

## Overview

This project is a **Spam Classifier** developed using **Machine Learning** and deployed as an **interactive web application** using **Streamlit**. It predicts whether a given SMS message is spam or not using a trained classification model. The web app allows users to easily classify messages in a real-time, user-friendly interface.

### Key Features:
- **User-friendly Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **SMS Spam Classification**: Users can input an SMS message and instantly receive the classification result (Spam or Not Spam).
- **Model Accuracy**: The model is trained on a real-world SMS dataset to provide accurate results.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users get immediate feedback on the input message classification.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used for building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used for building the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **GitHub**: For version control and code hosting.
- **Heroku (Optional)**: For deployment, if needed for production.
